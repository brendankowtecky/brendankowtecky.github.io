The largest of the bunch had managed to score a tasty lunch. The eagle tore into its meal while the others kept close, waiting to claim the scraps.

		            		It is said that in Rugged Point Provincial Park on the west coast of Vancouver Island, the bears and cougars outnumber humans in the park. This bear (the fourth one we saw within the first hour of being in the park) was certainly the largest black bear I have ever seen. He appeared out of the forest just as we were getting into our kayaks. He allowed us to watch him graze for over 20 minutes as we sat only a a handful of meters away floating in our kayaks. He would scratch against a small cedar tree and would occasionally look up and watch us for a short while before going back to his grazing.

		            </h5><p>
		            		It was the final day of a five day trip to the Slate Islands along Lake Superior. Myself and one of the guests woke up before sunrise to paddle over to Spar Island, only a few kilometres away. We were getting picked up by a water taxi just before noon that day and had still not seen any woodland caribou. A slight disappointment hung in the air, as the guest with me was doing a story for National Geographic on the Woodland Caribou, but had had no encounters thus far. As we paddled back to the rest of the group at the campsite, we suddenly spotted a mother and calf jump into the water only twenty odd meters ahead of us. The Woodland Caribou on these islands are strong swimmers and can easily swim a few kilometres without much effort. After a few photographs were taken, we were able to enjoy the spectacle for some time before heading back to camp. Our timing was incredibly lucky, as we were picked up by our taxi less than an hour after.

		            		As I strolled through a city park on the outskirts of Auckland, I came upon a handful of swans resting on the shore. Trying to get as close as I could without disturbing them, I crept along until the swan filled the entire frame. A quick release of the shutter and then a slow retreat back away from the birds allowed them to continue their afternoon nap unfazed, and for me to continue my afternoon stroll.

		            		After a failed attempt of trying to capture a sunrise over the Fitz Roy range, I began the long hike back towards the hostel we were staying at in town. Along the trail I noticed a couple of parakeets. They seemed to be unphased by my presence, which allowed me the opportunity to take photographs of them as they munched away. Not quite what I had in mind when I got up that morning to take photographs, but a pleasant surprise after being skunked by the sunrise.

		            </h5><p>
		            		It is incredibly lucky to see a whale breach once. However, seeing a whale lift its 40 tonne body into the air 12 times in a row is even more of a rare event! There are multiple reasons and beliefs on why whales fling there bodies out of the water. After watching this one, I could only think that it was for the sheer joy of being free in such nutrient rich waters.

The snow was slowly falling in large flakes and this sleepy seal seemed to be pretty content with where it was. Weddell Seals have a very short cat like face and a rather small head in comparison to their body.

		            		A lone Adelie penguin stands on a piece of freshly rolled ice. There are well over one hundred thousand penguins that nest on Paulet Island in the Weddell Sea. Strong currents in the area and lots of sea ice make it difficult to be able to explore Paulet Island often. Any chance to explore the east side of the peninsula is always a treat. Although this visit to Paulet held dark skies above, the ice and wind conditions were good. This allowed us to cruise around both in zodiacs and on foot and check out these quirky species of penguins up close.

		            		A raft of Gentoo penguins swim by just off Danco Island. Penguins will swim together in rafts so they are safer from predators. Leopard seals and orcas are two species that will actively hunt down penguins. Although travelling in a raft is safer, it is also slower. Once food is found, penguins will often break off from the raft and begin hunting their own prey.

		            		Living on South Georgia means being ready to deal with some pretty nasty weather conditions. As the rain set in, most people seemed concerned with trying to keep themselves (or at least their camera gear) protected from the elements. However, the local wildlife seemed unphased with the change of weather and continued about fishing, marking their territory, and rolling back and forth in the tussock grass.

On land, you can occasionally see penguins holding their flippers out to the side when a breeze comes by to help cool themselves off.

An unusually cold fall in Squamish meant that the banks of the river were covered in snow early on. This particular young eagle continued to dive towards the other eagles looking to steal a free meal. He remained unsuccessful throughout the couple hours I watched him.

Eventually I decided that the hare had won this game of hide and seek and pressed onwards.

As we drifted past, one of the cubs seemed to show more interest, while the other seemed to prefer the protection of its mother.

After looking briefly to the left and the right he disappeared back behind his cover behind the ice.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Rock Hopper penguins are essentially the badasses of all penguin species. Living on remote and exposed rocky coastlines, these penguins swim, surf, and scramble their way through massive crashing seas every time they need to feed. Even though they may be one of the smallest species of penguins, they certainly have some of the biggest personalities.

		            </h5><p>
		            		While spending the night on Maggie Point in the Broughton Islands Archipelago Marine Park, we had the fortunate opportunity to watch three grizzlies hang out out by the waters edge only 10 metres from our site. A mother and two cubs grazed along the shore looking for some intertidal life to eat while myself and the group I was guiding stayed close together watching as the bears flipped 50kg rocks with ease. The show went on for over 45 minutes and the bears retreated to the forest once they had finished their circuit. A safe and successful wildlife encounter for both us and the grizzlies.

		            </h5><p>
		            		On a nine day solo kayaking trip through Desolation Sound and the Discovery Islands I noticed a rock with some California sea lions hauled out. These sea lions may appear to be clumsy and awkward out of the water, but once they slip back in to their underwater world, they because agile predators. Although they are smaller than the Stellar sea lion (the other large pinniped in the area) the males can still weigh between six to eight hundred pounds.

		            </h5><p>
		            		While paddling through Desolation Sound and the Discovery Islands, a small black bear made its way out of the forest and down along the beach to pick along the boulder beach at low tide. After having his fill there, he scrambled up the rocky shoreline without an issue before disappearing back into the forest.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Paddling between Sonora and Stuart Island involves trying to make your way through at least three sets of tidal rapids. Throughout this narrow passage, many nutrients are pushed up towards the top of the water which attracts lots of seabirds to the area. Bonaparte Gulls are one the species that you can see in abundance throughout this turbulent area. A beautiful species of gull that has a very distinct pure place head.

		            </h5><p>
		            		While camping on a small island near Quadra Island, a family of four raccoons headed out from the trees and scurried their way to the edge of the water. All four of them took turns wading waist deep into the water, trying to sneak some free meals while the tide was out. The raccoons seemed generally unphased by my appearance and continued to move closer and closer to my perch on a boulder nearby.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Towards the end of a five day paddling trip around Desolation Sound, I spotted a heron perched by the water's edge. As I paddled towards it he turned sideways, which led to a very nice composition with the snow capped peaks of Strathcona Provincial Park in the background. Herons are rather large with their wing span reaching over six feet. They are also incredibly light, and weigh just 2 kilograms.

		            </h5><p>
		            		While guiding a group through the Plumper Islands Ecological Reserve, we landed our kayaks on a small rocky islet to have lunch. I didn’t notice the bald eagle that sat only a few meters away until I was already out of my boat. I managed to capture a few quick pictures of it, but was surprised when he started coming even closer to the kayaks. He crept towards the kayaks until he was almost within arms reach and then took off right in front of us. A very close encounter by anyone’s standard!

		            </h5><p>
		            		On a 6 day expedition through Nuchatlitz Marine Provincial Park we faced multiple days of strong winds. These winds limited where we could paddle and forced us to explore some islands and channels that normally don’t get much attention. As the group rounded the corner we noticed a pack of around 10 coastal wolves swimming from a small islet to Nootka Island. The alpha male swam across first, but then stood guard to make sure that all the others made it across safely. By this point, the wolves had taken notice of us and scurried across the beach and into the forest.

		            </h5><p>
		            		By the early twentieth century, sea otters had been extirpated from the British Columbian coast. They had essentially been hunted to extinction on the coast for their fur, which is the densest in the world. In one square centimetre, sea otters can have between 100-150 thousand hairs. Around 1970, a handful of sea otters were re-introduced from the Aleutian Islands back along the BC coast. Since then, they have done extremely well and their population is now around six thousand.
