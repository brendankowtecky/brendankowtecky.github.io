		            		The Madawaska River holds many memories for me. It was where I had my first taste of whitewater kayaking, where I worked as a raft guide, and where I grew my confidence as a paddler.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Sailing along the west coast of Greenland, we spotted one of the largest icebergs that I have ever seen. We were able to calculate an estimated height of close to 90 metres (300 feet). As 80-90% of an iceberg sits below the surface of the water, this made for some impressive stats!

		            </h5><p>
		            		Large tabular icebergs break off from ice shelves along the continent of Antarctica and begin their voyage out to sea. The majority of them do not melt throughout the summer and can last for years. The largest tabular icebergs are tens of kilometres long and can last for decades, travelling hundreds of kilometres. The one photographed here is a rather small one, especially when compared to the previously mentioned giants.

		            </h5><p>
		            		It may sound a little cliché, but I do believe that every piece of ice has a story to tell. From their humble beginnings as flakes of snow to their present day state as awe-inspiring giants, ihe icebergs around Antarctica all come with scars and stories. This one in particular showcased some very interesting marks, and can only leave us guessing what type of journey it may have gone through.

		            		Visiting Illulissat in almost any weather condition is a treat. This particular visit came with overcast skies and flat light. With the subtle hints of grey and blue in the ice perfectly matching the sky, it made for a compelling scene that seemed to all blend as one.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Heading east from Illulissat, we spotted one of the most incredible icebergs I have ever seen. Hundreds of feet tall and with multiple arches and caves, it was quite a sight. We circled this iceberg twice, hoping we may be lucky enough to see one of the arches collapse. However, it remained fully intact during our brief visit. The fantastic shapes and sizes that nature forms these pieces of ice into always amazes me.

		            </h5><p>
		            		The Skontorp Glacier is one of the most scenic glaciers I have been fortunate to visit. Tucked in the back of Paradise Bay along the Antarctic Peninsula, it rarely sees any rough water conditions, making for sublime kayaking. You can hear collapsing and calving off of its terminal face regularly. Being a tidewater glacier (one that terminates in the ocean and not on land), it is best to give it a bit of space.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Early in the morning while heading north into Lancaster Sound, a stray iceberg drifted by. A dark sky cast behind it, and the sun’s low rays shone warm light onto the ice. The contrasting tones created a compelling scene and made for a obvious capture.

		            </h5><p>
		            		This area was referred to as the “true right” of the lower glacier. The Fox glacier had been primarily retreating for many decades, but melting has significantly increased in the past couple decades. When a glacier retreats, it doesn’t just shrink in length, but also deflates its width and height. While photographing this image, it was difficult to remember that I had been approximately 50 feet higher along the lateral moraine just one year earlier. The glacier has continued to retreat and the area in this photograph no longer exists.

		            </h5><p>
		            		During one of my first visits up to the Victoria Flats of Fox Glacier, we visited a dried up moulin. A moulin (a French word meaning windmill) is where the meltwater drains from the surface of the glacier down into the interior. The water creates fantastic patterns and shapes in the ice and can create caves that extend for hundreds of metres.

		            </h5><p>
		            		On a trip down to Argentina, we visited the infamous Perito Merino Glacier. This glacier is well known for its consistent calving and close vantage points for tourists. This is one of the few glaciers that is actually slowly advancing. An accumulation of snow in the mountains slowly gets collected and compressed into the ice. If this accumulation of snow is larger than the amount of ice that is melting from the lower glacier, then the glacier can grow.

		            </h5><p>
		            		One of the interesting things about the Perito Merino Glacier is how close its terminal face is to colliding with the viewpoint. The majority of the glacier terminates in a lake, however, a small portion of it actually connects to the mainland by only a few dozen meters (as of 2018). This means that trees, bushes, and ferns can grow right in front of the ice - a sight that is not often associated with glaciers.

		            </h5><p>
		            		The terminal (front) face of the Skontorp Glacier actually finishes in the ocean. This means that the ice can continue to extend below the surface of the water even when it appears to have stopped above. This means that all boats should remain further from these types of glaciers, as they can calve off unexpectedly and shoot ice up towards the surface of the water hundreds of metres in front of the glacier.

		            		While zodiac cruising in Antarctica, we stopped to view a leopard seal cruising along the surface. Just to the left of us was an iceberg etched with incredible lines and features that resembled a face. Personally, I find that ice has a similar effect as clouds - it is easy to gaze at and imagine the myriad of different objects and things that it could be.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Getting to view a glacier from below is a rare experience. While working at Fox Glacier, a cave formed in the terminal face that, for a short while, was deemed safe to enter. After crawling through a small entrance, the cave opened up to provide a unique view of the glacier from below. Unfortunately, the cave was considered unsafe after only a few days and we were no longer encouraged to visit. I only ended up bringing my camera into the cave once, but was happy to capture a few images before it was no longer accessible.

		            </h5><p>
		            		This picture is one that helps me remember just how dynamic and fragile these ice landscapes are. Viewing this beautiful cave from inside seemed like the appropriate decision early in the morning (whether it was or was not appropriate is a decision I still question). However, towards the end of a blistering hot day, I decided to take a walk by the outside of the cave once more (not planning on retuning inside). Almost the entire cave had collapsed in on itself. This is an event that could have turned out very differently, and is one that I think about regularly when evaluating risk versus reward throughout my guiding career.

		            		Upon entering Fournier Bay, we passed by this stunning iceberg on the ship's port side. This photograph was a quick snap, and after one or two pictures I returned to my previous task. However, when I reviewed the images later on, I became enthralled by the presence that this iceberg possessed in the picture. To this day, it has remained on of my favourite images.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Shooting ice from above gives an interesting perspective to how seemingly random pieces may be connected and how they may at one time have fit together. Contrasted against the dark cold water of the Arctic Ocean, it is easy to see how these pieces of sea ice are connected, and are actually just one larger piece of sea ice.

		            		Photographing ice in high contrast situations can make for some stunning images. This picture was captured just moments before a storm crashed down over the ice fjord. As I have previously mentioned, photographing ice (not only in the ice fjord, but also on glaciers and in the ocean) in different weather conditions can produce drastically different results. Some of my favourite images have been taken on either dark or overcast days after capturing nothing previously on clearer days.

		            </h5><p>
		            		This image was captured towards the bottom of what was considered the “lower icefall” on Fox Glacier. During the time that I worked on the glacier, it was divided into five sections: the lower glacier (day use area), the lower icefall, the Victoria flats, the upper icefall,  and the névé. Each of these sections had distinct hazards and characteristics. The lower glacier was characterized by  gentler terrain that was partially covered by a moraine. The lower icefall was a steep jump that involved challenging terrain and steeper walls. The Victoria flats encompassed a flatter section of the glacier that was perfect for exploring with guests. The upper icefall, an extremely steep large portion of the glacier, moved downhill at the average rate of a few metres per day. It was considered inaccessible by most. On top of the icefall was the Fox névé, which was essentially the collection basin of snow that fed the glacier.

		            </h5><p>
		            		Crevasses are a regular occurrence on steeper sections of glaciers. They fracture the surface ice and can extend deep down into the lower recesses of the glacier. Crossing crevassed terrain should either be avoided or be done with proper training. The crevasse pictured here was only a couple of metres across, but they can easily reach tens or hundreds of metres across, making travel extremely difficult.
