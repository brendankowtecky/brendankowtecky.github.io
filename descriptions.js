Strong and agile swimmers, they can swim up to twelve kilometres per hour (not nearly as fast as Gentoo penguins, which top out close to forty kilometres per hour). Their feathers are incredibly intricate and help protect them from the cold sub-Antarctic water. They spend hours per day constantly cleaning and preening their feathers. The chicks have a thick fuzzy brown coat, and look very different from the adult King penguins. Early explorers to South Georgia actually thought that King penguin chicks were an entirely different species from the adults.",

Only a handful of fur seals were left alive (simply because they were not found), and in the early 20th century they were no longer allowed to be hunted. Since then, they have made an incredible recovery. In just over 100 years, it is now thought that their population is somewhere around 6 million. Roughly 95% of the population lives on South Georgia Island. Throughout the summer months you now find the beaches literally packed with fur seal pups. It is fantastic to see these animals rebound so quickly after nearly being driven to extinction.",

It is rare to see a single Adelie dive into the water from the ice or a beach, and  much more common to see dozens of them jump in (or out) one after the other.

The orcas repeatedly breached, tail slapped, and rolled for over half an hour. Our ship stopped hundreds of metres away, but one of the larger females came over a handful of times directly below the ship to see what was going on. The orcas could have quickly ended the seal's life in a matter of seconds, but the family was training the younger members how to kill prey. After all the orcas had their turn pushing the seal around, a large female threw the seal several metres into the air, fatally injuring it and finally ending the epic event.",

It will quite often have white (or blonde) fur, but still have regular coloured eyes or patterns on its skin. It differs slightly from albinism. Roughly one in one thousand fur seals are leucistic. Because of their brighter “coloured” coat, they quite often are easier for their predators to spot and do not make it to adulthood. During my first year visiting South Georgia, I was lucky enough to spot one of these leucistic seals. In my second year I spotted eight, including one full grown male.",

Without a cloud in the sky and no wind to speak of, the temperature rose towards the mid twenties. For a location whose temperature is normally moderated by the ocean and its breeze, this felt especially warm. When we reached the Albatross colony, the chicks (that were now a few months old) were all continuously panting. They still had a thick coat of feathers and could not yet leave the nest. If the temperature lasted like this much longer, they would surely overheat. Fortunately, the heat did not last. By the next morning the wind picked up and the temperature dropped back into the mid-teens.",

A slight disappointment hung in the air, as the guest with me was doing a story for National Geographic on the Woodland Caribou, but had had no encounters thus far. As we paddled back to the rest of the group at the campsite, we suddenly spotted a mother and calf jump into the water only twenty odd meters ahead of us. The Woodland Caribou on these islands are strong swimmers and can easily swim a few kilometres without much effort. After a few photographs were taken, we were able to enjoy the spectacle for some time before heading back to camp.

		   "description": "Hanging out near the town of Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, I spotted an Arctic hare while hiking. I tried sneaking around to capture an image of the hare, shooting straight towards it. Every time I moved a few feet in a certain direction, the hare would immediately make a movement in the counter direction keeping its face hidden for more then half an hour. Eventually I decided that the hare had won this game of hide and seek and pressed onwards.",

The Northern Rockhopper penguin was one of many unique species that we saw during our short visits to the islands.",

During the time that I worked on the glacier, it was divided into five sections: the lower glacier (day use area), the lower icefall, the Victoria flats, the upper icefall,  and the névé. Each of these sections had distinct hazards and characteristics. The lower glacier was characterized by  gentler terrain that was partially covered by a moraine. The lower icefall was a steep jump that involved challenging terrain and steeper walls. The Victoria flats encompassed a flatter section of the glacier that was perfect for exploring with guests. The upper icefall, an extremely steep large portion of the glacier, moved downhill at the average rate of a few metres per day. It was considered inaccessible by most. On top of the icefall was the Fox névé, which was essentially the collection basin of snow that fed the glacier.",

Throughout my time working on Fox Glacier, I often found myself drawn towards these falls, trying to capture the the power of the thunderous cascade. The steep cliffs of ice and rock around the falls only added to its grandeur. I never was able to photograph this waterfall the way I imagined, but was still pleased with the end result of some more cropped in portions.",

I knew I had to return the next morning (our last in El Chalten) for sunrise. I woke up around 4:30am and began trudging my way up the steep terrain. Towards the top of the hike, I realized that the sun was just moments away from rising and that I would need to sprint the last couple hundred metres if I was to make it to the top in time. I managed to get to the viewpoint just as the sun's light began to hit the mountains. I would take a few frames and then lower my camera so I could pant and try and catch my breath. This process repeated for nearly ten minutes. Shortly after the sun rose, clouds moved in and shrouded the view of the mountains. I was very pleased that I was able to make it to the top for sunrise and capture the few minutes of great light for the day.",

This small provincial park showcases an impressive stretch of river that cascades and tumbles through a beautiful canyon. The hike is mostly flat and is family friendly. Depending on the time of year you visit, the water can either be a brown/grey colour (from all the sediment), or a turquoise blue colour when the river is at lower flows. Both the upper and lower falls are close to 30 meters (100 ft) and are worth the visit if you find yourself driving by.",

If you can put up with consistently damp gear and limited sunlight, it can be a truly magical time to visit this portion of the British Columbian coast.",

Over time, the material has ground up and worn down, often times creating a pleasing white shell beach.",

The islands, however, are quite exposed, and the few trees that grow on them are all sculpted by the wind. My first visit to the White Cliff Islets involved a visit from a breaching humpback whale and an incredible sunset with dark stormy skies behind. It is a destination all unto itself.",

Near the southwest corner of the islands, a handful of channels cut right through the islands. Most are only a handful of metres wide, but can be surrounded by cliffs nearly one hundred metres tall. On this particular occasion, almost every channel seemed to be chocked by an iceberg. A couple of the channels seemed to be ice-free for their entire length, only to be thwarted by a single chunk of ice at the very end. It made the exploration even more enticing. But eventually, after being blocked at each and every channel, we were forced to go around the entire tip of the island.",

The glaciers have also retreated significantly, exposing even more of the distinct brown cliffs for which this place is named.

Massive amounts of ice choke the passages near the shore, and steep rocky peaks fall straight down for thousands of feet into the southern ocean. The waters are filled with life through the summer months. Whales, seals, and penguins all call this place home. The sun hangs in the sky all day and night and only disappears for a few hours early and later in the season. It is magical place that I have been privileged to visit time and time again.",

One thing that these short rainy days can be great for, however, are for exploring the forests and rivers close to home. In North Vancouver I am lucky enough to be surrounded by a multitude of paths and trails that take me to hidden waterfalls, through patches of old growth forest, and alongside mountainous ridges. These local adventures may be less grandiose compared to some of the more remote expeditions that I have taken part in, but they are just as important when it comes to giving me an appreciation of the incredible landscapes that I am so lucky to explore.",
