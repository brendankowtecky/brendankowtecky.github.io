Strong and agile swimmers, they can swim up to twelve kilometres per hour (not nearly as fast as Gentoo penguins, which top out close to forty kilometres per hour). Their feathers are incredibly intricate and help protect them from the cold sub-Antarctic water. They spend hours per day constantly cleaning and preening their feathers. The chicks have a thick fuzzy brown coat, and look very different from the adult King penguins. Early explorers to South Georgia actually thought that King penguin chicks were an entirely different species from the adults.",

Only a handful of fur seals were left alive (simply because they were not found), and in the early 20th century they were no longer allowed to be hunted. Since then, they have made an incredible recovery. In just over 100 years, it is now thought that their population is somewhere around 6 million. Roughly 95% of the population lives on South Georgia Island. Throughout the summer months you now find the beaches literally packed with fur seal pups. It is fantastic to see these animals rebound so quickly after nearly being driven to extinction.",

It is rare to see a single Adelie dive into the water from the ice or a beach, and  much more common to see dozens of them jump in (or out) one after the other.

The orcas repeatedly breached, tail slapped, and rolled for over half an hour. Our ship stopped hundreds of metres away, but one of the larger females came over a handful of times directly below the ship to see what was going on. The orcas could have quickly ended the seal's life in a matter of seconds, but the family was training the younger members how to kill prey. After all the orcas had their turn pushing the seal around, a large female threw the seal several metres into the air, fatally injuring it and finally ending the epic event.",

It will quite often have white (or blonde) fur, but still have regular coloured eyes or patterns on its skin. It differs slightly from albinism. Roughly one in one thousand fur seals are leucistic. Because of their brighter “coloured” coat, they quite often are easier for their predators to spot and do not make it to adulthood. During my first year visiting South Georgia, I was lucky enough to spot one of these leucistic seals. In my second year I spotted eight, including one full grown male.",

Without a cloud in the sky and no wind to speak of, the temperature rose towards the mid twenties. For a location whose temperature is normally moderated by the ocean and its breeze, this felt especially warm. When we reached the Albatross colony, the chicks (that were now a few months old) were all continuously panting. They still had a thick coat of feathers and could not yet leave the nest. If the temperature lasted like this much longer, they would surely overheat. Fortunately, the heat did not last. By the next morning the wind picked up and the temperature dropped back into the mid-teens.",

A slight disappointment hung in the air, as the guest with me was doing a story for National Geographic on the Woodland Caribou, but had had no encounters thus far. As we paddled back to the rest of the group at the campsite, we suddenly spotted a mother and calf jump into the water only twenty odd meters ahead of us. The Woodland Caribou on these islands are strong swimmers and can easily swim a few kilometres without much effort. After a few photographs were taken, we were able to enjoy the spectacle for some time before heading back to camp.

		   "description": "Hanging out near the town of Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, I spotted an Arctic hare while hiking. I tried sneaking around to capture an image of the hare, shooting straight towards it. Every time I moved a few feet in a certain direction, the hare would immediately make a movement in the counter direction keeping its face hidden for more then half an hour. Eventually I decided that the hare had won this game of hide and seek and pressed onwards.",

The Northern Rockhopper penguin was one of many unique species that we saw during our short visits to the islands.",

As I have previously mentioned, photographing ice (not only in the ice fjord, but also on glaciers and in the ocean) in different weather conditions can produce drastically different results. Some of my favourite images have been taken on either dark or overcast days after capturing nothing previously on clearer days.",

Just to the left of us was an iceberg etched with incredible lines and features that resembled a face. Personally, I find that ice has a similar effect as clouds - it is easy to gaze at and imagine the myriad of different objects and things that it could be.",

		   "description": "This image was captured towards the bottom of what was considered the “lower icefall” on Fox Glacier. During the time that I worked on the glacier, it was divided into five sections: the lower glacier (day use area), the lower icefall, the Victoria flats, the upper icefall,  and the névé. Each of these sections had distinct hazards and characteristics. The lower glacier was characterized by  gentler terrain that was partially covered by a moraine. The lower icefall was a steep jump that involved challenging terrain and steeper walls. The Victoria flats encompassed a flatter section of the glacier that was perfect for exploring with guests. The upper icefall, an extremely steep large portion of the glacier, moved downhill at the average rate of a few metres per day. It was considered inaccessible by most. On top of the icefall was the Fox névé, which was essentially the collection basin of snow that fed the glacier.",

Viewing this beautiful cave from inside seemed like the appropriate decision early in the morning (whether it was or was not appropriate is a decision I still question). However, towards the end of a blistering hot day, I decided to take a walk by the outside of the cave once more (not planning on retuning inside). Almost the entire cave had collapsed in on itself. This is an event that could have turned out very differently, and is one that I think about regularly when evaluating risk versus reward throughout my guiding career.",

The icebergs through the Errera Channel, during this particular visit to Antarctica, fell very much into the second category. Every small feature on the faces of these large icebergs are created by some natural event. These massive structures are sculpted by wind, waves, rock, and sun. Over time, they are compressed, rolled, smashed, and smoothed out by the elements to create natural works of art.",

The Fox glacier had been primarily retreating for many decades, but melting has significantly increased in the past couple decades. When a glacier retreats, it doesn’t just shrink in length, but also deflates its width and height. While photographing this image, it was difficult to remember that I had been approximately 50 feet higher along the lateral moraine just one year earlier. The glacier has continued to retreat and the area in this photograph no longer exists.",

Due to the effects of the water, they tend to be quite active and even more unpredictable than other types of glaciers. While visiting Neko Harbour, it is always important to never linger by the water's edge. It is not uncommon for large pillars or sections to break off, causing large waves that can come barrelling towards shore.",

		   "description": "As a glacier stops advancing and starts to recede, its appearance begin to change. Not only does it decrease lengthwise, but it also can shrink in width and especially in thickness. It is a visual that I normally liken to a deflating balloon. Glaciers that were once out over the ocean may retreat back over the land, and large vertical faces may begin to collapse and crumble. Most glaciers worldwide are in a retreating phase. Glaciers have advanced and retreated for thousands of years in a natural cycle. However, the current rate at which they disappearing is the question we should be addressing.",
